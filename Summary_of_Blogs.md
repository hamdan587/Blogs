## Blog 1: Building a Scalable Microservices Architecture Using Docker
**Link:** [https://medium.com/@hamdanali051/how-to-build-a-scalable-microservices-architecture-using-docker-d0fef097d917](#)

**Summary:**
In this blog, I explain how to design and build a scalable microservices architecture using Docker. I break down the process into key steps:
1. **Designing Microservices** – Breaking down the application into small, independent services.
2. **Docker Containers** – Containerizing each service with Docker to ensure portability, isolation, and scalability.
3. **Docker Compose** – Using Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
4. **Kubernetes** – Scaling with Kubernetes for large deployments.
5. **Monitoring and Logging** – Using Prometheus and the ELK Stack to monitor performance and troubleshoot.

By using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, we can build a flexible and scalable architecture to meet the demands of modern applications.

## Blog 2: Building Scalable Kubernetes Applications with EKS Node Groups
**Link:** [https://medium.com/@hamdanali051/building-scalable-kubernetes-applications-with-eks-node-groups-dbb36854c3f7](#)

**Summary:**
In this blog, I explain how to use Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) Node Groups to build scalable Kubernetes applications. EKS simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of containerized applications, and Node Groups are key to managing Kubernetes worker nodes effectively.
1. **What are Node Groups?** – I explain that Node Groups in EKS are collections of EC2 instances that enable effective scaling and management of Kubernetes worker nodes.
2. **Types of Node Groups** – Managed Node Groups (automatically managed by AWS) and Self-Managed Node Groups (where I have more control over the nodes).
3. **Setting Up Node Groups** – I walk through setting up an EKS cluster and node group using `eksctl`.
4. **Deploying and Auto-Scaling Applications** – I show how to deploy a simple Nginx application and set up auto-scaling with Kubernetes.
5. **Exposing the Application** – I demonstrate how to expose the application using a LoadBalancer.

Using EKS Node Groups, we can scale applications easily, ensure high availability, and reduce management overhead, making it a powerful tool for building scalable Kubernetes applications.
