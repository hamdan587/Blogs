## ðŸ“– **Blog 1: Building a Scalable Microservices Architecture Using Docker**

**Link:** https://medium.com/@hamdanali051/how-to-build-a-scalable-microservices-architecture-using-docker-d0fef097d917

**Summary:**

In this blog, I walk you through the steps of building a scalable microservices architecture using **Docker**. The key steps include:

### ðŸ”¹ **Designing Microservices:**
- Break down your application into small, independent services for better scalability and management.

### ðŸ”¹ **Docker Containers:**
- Use Docker to containerize each service, ensuring portability, isolation, and scalability across environments.

### ðŸ”¹ **Docker Compose for Multi-Container Management:**
- Define and manage multiple containers easily using Docker Compose for your application's services.

### ðŸ”¹ **Scaling with Kubernetes:**
- For large deployments, Kubernetes orchestration is introduced to scale your microservices effectively.

### ðŸ”¹ **Monitoring and Logging:**
- Leverage **Prometheus** and **ELK Stack** for continuous monitoring, logging, and troubleshooting.

By using Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, you can design a flexible, scalable, and highly available microservices architecture.

## ðŸ“– **Blog 2: Building Scalable Kubernetes Applications with EKS Node Groups**

**Link:** [https://medium.com/@hamdanali051/building-scalable-kubernetes-applications-with-eks-node-groups-dbb36854c3f7](#)

**Summary:**

In this blog, I discuss how to use **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** Node Groups to build scalable Kubernetes applications. Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

### ðŸ”¸ **What are Node Groups in EKS?**
- Node Groups in EKS are collections of EC2 instances that manage Kubernetes worker nodes, making them easy to scale and optimize.

### ðŸ”¸ **Types of Node Groups:**
- **Managed Node Groups:** AWS handles lifecycle management automatically (updates, scaling).
- **Self-Managed Node Groups:** You control the nodes, including updates and scaling.

### ðŸ”¸ **Setting Up EKS Node Groups:**
- I provide steps to create an EKS cluster and node group using `eksctl` for seamless management.

### ðŸ”¸ **Deploying & Auto-Scaling Kubernetes Applications:**
- I demonstrate deploying a simple **Nginx** app and configuring auto-scaling with Kubernetes to adapt to traffic demands.

### ðŸ”¸ **Exposing the Application:**
- Use a LoadBalancer to expose the application and make it accessible from outside the Kubernetes cluster.

By leveraging EKS Node Groups, we can simplify Kubernetes application scaling and management, ensuring **high availability**, **resilience**, and **auto-scaling** with minimal operational overhead.
